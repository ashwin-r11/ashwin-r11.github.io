Keep updated at https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/\nFAQs: What is the goal of Google Summer of Code? to contribute to open source communities long after their GSoC program ends. When does Google Summer of Code happen? Please see the program timeline. What happens in Google Summer of Code? New contributors to open source will spend their summer writing code for an open source organization under the guidance of mentors from their new open source community. Why does Google run the Google Summer of Code program? Google is committed to growing the open source ecosystem. The more open source developers there are in the world, the healthier and more sustainable the entire community will be.\nSince 2005, the Google Summer of Code program has brought together over 20,000 new contributors/students with over 800 open source organizations under the guidance of 19,000+ mentors.\nIs Google Summer of Code (GSoC) a recruiting program? No. If you are interested in working for Google, please visit the Google jobs website. Is GSoC considered an internship, a job, or any form of employment? No. GSoC is an activity that a participant performs as an independent developer for which they are paid a stipend. Participants are not employed by, working at, or for, Google. Are mentoring organizations required to use the code produced by students? No. While we hope that all the code that comes out of this program will find a happy home, we donâ€™t require organizations to use the contributor\u0026rsquo;s code. Where does GSoC occur? Google Summer of Code occurs entirely online; there is no requirement to travel as part of the program. What can I do to help spread the word about GSoC? You can download flyers to post at university campuses, local developer meetups, etc. You can also use your various social media platforms to spread word about the program,or host a meetup or information session in your area. We also have a template email you can use to distribute to your community (school, developer, etc.) and other contacts. How do I organize or host a GSoC information session or meetup? You are welcome to schedule an online session or meetup at whatever time and place is convenient for you! Please review the Program Rules first and utilize our presentation template and flyers. Can I participate in GSoC as both a mentor and a GSoC Contributor? No. Mentors are people who have been involved in an open source organization and wish to help guide new contributors to their community in the GSoC program. GSoC contributors are people who are new to an open source organization. Are participants from Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus allowed to participate in GSoC 2024? Due to current circumstances, GSoC 2024 is not accepting participants (Contributors, Mentors or Organization Administrators) from Russia, Belarus, or the so-called Donetsk People\u0026rsquo;s Republic (\u0026ldquo;DNR\u0026rdquo;) and Luhansk People\u0026rsquo;s Republic (\u0026ldquo;LNR\u0026rdquo;). There are no restrictions on participants located within Ukraine but outside of the DNR and LNR. What if I have more questions? Check out the Contributor Guide and other pages on this site. If after reading through all the documentation you still don\u0026rsquo;t have an answer please consider reaching out to the GSoC community via the discussion list or IRC channel.
